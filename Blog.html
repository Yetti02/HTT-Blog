            <h2>Being a Beginner Front-End Developer</h2>
            <p>Starting out as a front-end developer can be both exciting and overwhelming.
                It's a journey filled with learning new languages, 
                mastering design principles, and understanding the needs of users.
                 Here’s a breakdown of what you can expect and some tips to guide you along the way</p>

            <p> The first thing you need to do is to have a firm grasp of the basics,
                once this is done you are already halfway there. The basics includes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>HTML and CSS:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web pages. 
                            It structures the content.</li>
                        <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content, making it visually
                             appealing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Together, they form the foundation of web development. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>JavaScript:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>JavaScript brings interactivity to websites.It's essential for creating
                             dynamic and responsive experiences.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> Start with basic syntax, variables, 
                        and functions before moving on to more complex topics like DOM manipulation 
                        and event handling.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        
            <div>
                <p>You also need a good understanding of Web Design Principles such as: <em> 
                    Responsive Design, User Experience, </em>
                <p> There are also some very important tools that are needed for 
                    this fulfilling journey. They include:</p> 


      <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Text Editors and IDEs:</h4>
            <ul> <li>Getting comfortable with text editors like VS Code, Sublime Text, 
                or Atom will help make life more comfortable.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Version Control:</h4>
       <ul>
         <li>Learn Git and GitHub for version control.
            It’s crucial for collaborating with other developers and keeping track of your 
            projects.</li> </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
           <h4>Frameworks and Libraries:</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>Familiarize yourself with popular frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular. 
                They can speed up your development process and help manage complex applications
                .</li>  </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <div>
        <p> Once these are done the next thing you want to do is to practice by working on 
            small projects like personal blogs, portfolios, or simple web apps 
            which will help in applying what you’ve learned and build your portfolio. You will 
            also need to  deploy your
             projects using platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. 
            As this makes your work accessible to others and demonstrate your skills. </p>
        <p> While doing all these, you will still need to make sure you are well updated as the
             tech field is always evolving.
